Greetings, welcome to my GitHub repository. My name is Yacine Belalia, but you’ll find me everywhere using the username Yoctoscript. I’m a .NET Developer with almost 2 years of professional experience. I’m super comfortable with C# as a programming language and I practically use all the frameworks offered by the .NET ecosystem. My work-related repositories are all private; however, you can have a look at my public repositories which are a mix of all the things I love doing, sharpening my .NET skills, creating games in Unity, and experimenting with the Discord API.

Feel free to take a look at my degrees and [certifications](https://github.com/yoctoscript/yoctoscript/tree/main/Certifications). I also keep track of the books that I read (I’m very forgetful of the ones I’ve completed).

I have my socials listed on GitHub. If you’re actively recruiting or just a fellow .NET developer, feel free to contact me.
